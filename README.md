# Word-Search
Word Search class assignment

The program takes a commandline argument <textFile.txt>.

 The text file consists of the puzzle, followed by an empty line, 
then all the words to search for. The program will output to the 
commandline if the word was found in the puzzle, and if so, the start
and end coordiantes where the word was found (starting from 0 of course).
